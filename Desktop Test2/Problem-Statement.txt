Assessment: CAD Parts Repository System
Objective
Design and implement a console-based CAD Parts Repository System in C++,
demonstrating advanced programming concepts such as Object-Oriented
Design, templates, smart pointers, operator overloading, and dynamic
memory management.
Problem Statement
Your organization maintains a CAD Parts Repository for mechanical design
projects. You are required to create a C++ application that allows managing
CAD parts (e.g., Pipes, Valves, Elbows, Flanges) stored in memory. The system
should enable adding, viewing, searching, and deleting parts. Each part
should have common properties (like ID, name, material, diameter) and
specific properties depending on the type. The application must use a clean,
modular design and reflect a strong understanding of advanced C++
programming.
Requirements
? Your program should:
? Demonstrate strong Object-Oriented Design with inheritance and
polymorphism.
? Use templates and smart pointers for in-memory management.
? Employ operator overloading where relevant.
? Handle dynamic memory effectively (no leaks).
? Include error and exception handling for invalid inputs or operations.
? Follow modular structure (headers, source files, etc.).
? Use STL containers and algorithms appropriately.
? Include a simple console menu for interaction.
Concepts to Demonstrate
? OOP: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
? Smart Pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)

? Templates and Generic Programming
? Operator Overloading
? Exception Handling
? Dynamic Memory Management
? STL Containers and Iterators
? Code Modularity and Reusability
Suggested Duration
1 Day (8 Hrs.)
Evaluation Criteria
? Clarity of OOP design and class hierarchy
? Proper use of inheritance and polymorphism
? Implementation of templates or generic structures
? Correct use of smart pointers and memory management
? Use of operator overloading
? Implementation of exception handling
? Logical structuring of code and files
? Readability and commenting
? Effective use of STL containers
? Handling of user input and menu-driven flow
? Demonstration of reusability and extensibility in design
? Appropriate naming conventions and coding standards
? Functional correctness of operations (add/view/search/delete)
? Output clarity and formatting
? Innovation or additional useful features (optional)
Deliverables
? Source code files (.git link)
? Sample input/output screenshots/Videos
? README with brief explanation of design approach
