# Desktop Test2
The program I've written involves a base class, Parts which would essentially include all the Parts 
as derived classes, ie, Pipes, Valves, Elbows and Flanges.
I've written a template function for generic use of datatypes, handled a few exceptions, and wrote four helper 
functions, ie, AddParts(), ViewParts(), SearchParts(), DeleteParts() for adding, viewing, searching and deleting parts.
I've then gone on to write a while loop and a switch case within it in the main for taking input and giving output through helper functions
accordingly.
